\section{Minimizing error}
\subsection{Point representation}
Suppose we have N data points $x_i, i = 1,... , N$. Please find one single point to best represent these N data points.
\begin{answer}
    Initiate LH Algorithm:
\end{answer}

\subsection{Line representation}
 Suppose we have N pairs of data tuples: $(x_i, y_i), i = 1, ..., N$, where $x_i$ is a two dimensional vector $[x_{i1}, x_{i2}]^T$. Now we want to fit a line of form $y = w^T x + b + e$ to represent these N
data tuples, where e is error. Please find the best $\textbf{w}$ and $b$. You can use the methods you
learned in high school to solve this problem. And bonus points will be given to students
who solve this problem by matrix calculus.

\section{Separating Boundary}
Suppose we have two Gaussian distributions for two different classes of data $N(x|\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$
and $N(x|\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$, where x is a two-dimensional vector. For all $x_0$ that satisfy $N(x_0|\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$ =
$N(x_0|\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$, we call these $x_0$ as lying on the separating boundary. (We assume these
two classes have the same priors)

\subsection{Line boundary}
Suppose $N(x|\mu_1, \Sigma_1) = \frac{1}{{2\pi|\Sigma_1|}^{1/2}}exp{(-\frac{1}{2} (x - \mu_1)^T{\Sigma_1}^{-1}(x - \mu_1)}$, where
$$\mu_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} $$
and $$\Sigma_1 = \begin{vmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 &4\end{vmatrix} $$
Please find all settings of $\mu_2$ and $\Sigma_2$ that makes a straight line boundary between the two classes.
\begin{answer}
    Initiate LH Algorithm:
\end{answer}

\subsection{Other forms of boundary}
Discuss the conditions where the separating boundaries between the two classes are parabola,
hyperbola, ecllipse and line. Tips: you may want to refer to \url{ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section}.
\begin{answer}
    Initiate LH Algorithm:
\end{answer}

\subsection{Optional summary work}
\textbf{Note: this is an optional homework.} Please give your understanding of the reason
why error terms often subject to a Gaussian distribution. Students who complete this part
will get bonus points.
