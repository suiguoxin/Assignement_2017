\section{First Half}
\subsection{Do one of the followings:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Maximum Market Equilibrium Dynamics: Starting at truthful biddings,
    how would the player change their bids? Assuming best response, would the process converge?
    \item
    Prove or Disprove that the maximum revenue market equilibrium is a symmetric Nash Equilibrium in GSP.
    \item
    What is the maximum revenue symmetric Nash equilibrium in GSP?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
  Yes.
\end{answer}

\subsection{Do two of the followings:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    How much one can gain from VCG to maximum VCG?
    \item
    Give Examples where maximum VCG sells only one item. extend it to $k = 2,3,... ,m$ items.
    \item
    Call an case where only one item is sold VCG1, VCGk for k items where $k = 2,3,... ,m.$ How to compute them?
    \item
    Compare maximum VCG revenue to $VCG_1, VCG_2,... ,VCG_k$. Derive the best bound you may obtain.
    \item
    Design a truthful mechanism that derives a best bound in revenue against that of VCG1.
    Compare your revenue against that of $VCG_1$. Extend to $VCG_k$, $k = 1,2,... ,m$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
  Yes.
\end{answer}
